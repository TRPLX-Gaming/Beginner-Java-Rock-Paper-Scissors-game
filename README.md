# Welcome to my first Java(text-based) game of ROCK PAPER SCISSORS 😅

Anyways to play it, simply download it(usually comes in the form of a zip file so figure out how to decompress it)

Then due to Java's secure nature of running only in it's own compiler, hope you have a JVM installed in your device so you can run the code plus it's text based so everything will be based on the input you type into the console

## How the game works?

- Selection of rounds
You'll be prompted to pick the number of rounds you want to play against the algorithm of the opponent built into the game. So input it and the game will continue till the number of rounds you picked is attained

- Player input and determination of score
After picking the number of rounds you want to play then you'll be prompted to pick either of Rock/Paper/Scissors. Type them in correctly unless the game ends. The algorithm selects a random item and checks whether if a winner is attained in thr round else a draw is called.

- Winner Determination
As the loop of rounds continue, eventually it all comes an end unless I create an endless mode🤔(comment if you would want it) and based on the score the winner is finalized. 

*Took me quite a while withstanding my beginner experience with the language, so positive feedback would be highly appreciated*😁
